My name is Giulia. I am a 22-year-old student learning to develop software, with a specialized interest in transportation, aviation, and medical technology. 🛬⚕️

I have experience with Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, C, and Scratch. I mainly program in Java, but I have plans to focus on JavaScript and HTML for web and mobile development. ☕

I also have experience using Angular, Docker, and SonarQube. 💻
